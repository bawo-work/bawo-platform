## 2026-01-28 15:30 — Critical Technical Questions Resolved

**Decision:** Resolved all 7 critical open questions from SDD Section 10 before starting implementation.

**Questions & Resolutions:**

1. **Self Protocol NFC on Tecno/Infinix devices**
   - Resolution: Self as default path, phone verification as opt-down
   - Self users: Full access, all tasks, $50/day limit
   - Phone users: Limited access, basic tasks, $10/day limit
   - Workers can upgrade from phone to Self anytime
   - Week 1 action: Test on 3 device models to optimize (not block)

2. **Celo gas fees during congestion**
   - Resolution: Not a concern, skip
   - Rationale: Celo fees consistently sub-cent, MiniPay processes millions of transactions
   - No action needed

3. **Self Protocol pricing**
   - Resolution: Get quote but not blocking launch
   - Rationale: Phone opt-down means pricing doesn't block MVP
   - Week 1 action: Email Self Protocol for quote (for unit economics)

4. **MiniPay PWA deep linking**
   - Resolution: Web-first, PWA as enhancement
   - Rationale: Web view functional, PWA install is nice-to-have
   - Sprint 1: Build web-first

5. **Supabase Realtime pricing at scale**
   - Resolution: Hybrid design (Realtime for active tasks, polling for dashboard)
   - Rationale: Measure in production, not a launch blocker
   - Sprint 2: Implement hybrid approach

6. **Kenya ODPC registration**
   - Resolution: File Week 1, operate during processing
   - Rationale: Standard practice, processing takes 30-90 days
   - Week 1 action: File registration

7. **Yellow Card backup integration**
   - Resolution: Defer to Month 3+
   - Rationale: MiniPay unlikely to restrict, low priority
   - No immediate action

**Impact:**
- No technical blockers to implementation
- Sprint 1 can proceed immediately
- Week 1 validation tasks added but run in parallel (non-blocking)
- Two-tiered verification approach (Self + phone) de-risks primary assumption

**Rationale:**
The Self-as-default with phone-opt-down strategy means we can launch regardless of:
- Self Protocol device compatibility results
- Self Protocol pricing quote
- Any single integration point failing

This significantly reduces technical risk for MVP launch.

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed with `/implement` to start Sprint 1
- Complete Week 1 validation tasks in parallel
- Document validation results in `docs/validation/`
