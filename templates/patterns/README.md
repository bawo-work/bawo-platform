# Reusable Patterns

Patterns are proven solutions to common problems.
Extract patterns from successful implementations.

## How to Use

1. Check if a pattern exists before solving from scratch
2. Follow the pattern's structure
3. Adapt to your specific needs
4. If you improve a pattern, update it

## How to Add a Pattern

1. Create `patterns/<name>.md` using this structure:
   ```markdown
   # Pattern: <name>

   ## Problem
   <situation that triggers this pattern>

   ## Solution
   <how to solve it>

   ## Example
   <concrete code or steps>

   ## When to Use
   - <condition>

   ## When NOT to Use
   - <condition>

   ## Related Patterns
   - <other patterns>
   ```

2. Add to index below
3. Reference from relevant agent or template

## Pattern Index

| Pattern | Problem | Location |
|---------|---------|----------|
| (none yet) | | |

## Suggesting Patterns

When you notice:
- Same solution used 3+ times
- Clever solution worth preserving
- Common mistake worth preventing

-> Extract it as a pattern.
