## Part 4: Cold Email Templates (Tailored by Category)

### Template A: African Fintech

**Subject:** Swahili sentiment data for [Company] - quick question

```
Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is [specific observation - e.g., "expanding M-Pesa's AI features" 
or "hiring for ML roles focused on customer experience"].

Quick question: How are you currently handling Swahili text analysis for 
[specific use case - e.g., "customer support tickets" or "fraud detection"]?

We're building Bawo - a platform with native Kenyan speakers (Swahili, 
Sheng, Kenyan English) doing AI data labeling. We're currently building 
a Swahili sentiment dataset (5,000 examples, 90%+ inter-annotator agreement).

If this is relevant, I'd love to share a sample and get your feedback on 
whether the labels match what you'd need.

Would a 15-minute call this week work?

Best,
[Name]

P.S. [Personal touch - e.g., "Saw your talk at [conference] - the point 
about [specific thing] resonated with our approach."]
```

---

### Template B: Academic/Research

**Subject:** Swahili code-switching dataset - collaboration?

```
Hi [Professor/Dr. Name],

I read your paper on [specific paper] - particularly the section on 
[specific finding]. Really interesting approach to [topic].

I'm building Bawo, a data labeling platform focused on Kenyan languages. 
We're creating what might be the first dedicated Swahili code-switching 
dataset: 3,000 examples with span-level language tags (Swahili/English/Sheng).

Given your work on [related topic], I thought you might be interested in:
- Early access to the dataset for research
- Collaboration on annotation guidelines
- Co-authorship if there's a paper here

Would you have 20 minutes to discuss? I'd value your input on the 
annotation schema.

Best,
[Name]
```

---

### Template C: Big Tech AI

**Subject:** Native Swahili speakers for [Company]'s African language coverage

```
Hi [Name],

I noticed [specific observation - e.g., "NLLB's Swahili quality metrics 
are lower than other Bantu languages" or "GPT-4 struggles with Swahili 
code-switching"].

We're building Bawo - a platform connecting AI companies with native 
Kenyan speakers for data labeling. Our workers are actual native speakers 
in Nairobi, not offshore "Swahili proficient" annotators.

Currently building:
- Swahili sentiment dataset (5,000 examples)
- Kenyan code-switching corpus (Swahili/English/Sheng)
- Sheng lexicon (first of its kind)

Would [Company] be interested in:
a) Licensing these datasets when complete
b) Commissioning custom data collection
c) Both

Happy to share samples and methodology docs.

Best,
[Name]
```

---

### Template D: Voice/Speech Companies

**Subject:** East African voice data for [Company]

```
Hi [Name],

Saw that [Company] recently [specific news - e.g., "added Nigerian English 
to your supported accents" or "launched in Kenya"].

Question: How are you sourcing East African accent data? Specifically 
Kenyan English and Swahili?

We're building Bawo - a platform with native Kenyan speakers doing AI 
data tasks. We're planning an East African voice dataset:
- 1,000 unique speakers
- Kenyan English + Swahili
- Demographic metadata (age, region, gender)
- 10 phrases per speaker

If accent diversity is a priority for [Company], I'd love to discuss 
what format/content would be most useful.

Best,
[Name]
```

---

### Template E: Celo Ecosystem (Warm)

**Subject:** Bawo x [Company] - Swahili data for your users

```
Hi [Name],

[Mutual connection] suggested I reach out. I'm building Bawo - AI data 
labeling on Celo, targeting MiniPay's Kenyan users as workers.

We're creating Swahili/Kenyan language datasets and thought [Company] 
might benefit:
- [Specific use case for their product]
- [Another relevant application]

Since we're both building on Celo, there might be synergies beyond just 
data - happy to explore.

Coffee chat this week?

Best,
[Name]
```
