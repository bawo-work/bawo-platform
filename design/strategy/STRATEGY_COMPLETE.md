## Summary

### Positioning
**Bawo is what fair looks like when someone actually builds it.**

For AI companies that need African language data, Bawo is the data labeling platform that delivers native-speaker quality with instant worker payment, because we built the infrastructure to do micropayments right — proving ethical AI data doesn't require compromise.

### Target Audience
- **Workers:** Grace — Kenyan graduate who did everything right and wants dignified, reliable work
- **Clients:** Dr. Chen — ML lead who wants quality data, fast turnaround, no PR risk

### Brand Personality
- **Archetype:** The Competent Caregiver (not benefactor)
- **Core emotion:** Calm competence — the absence of anxiety
- **Voice:** Direct, warm, respectful
- **Visual:** Warm modern African — Java House meets Stripe

### Core Principle
Everything we claim, we prove.
