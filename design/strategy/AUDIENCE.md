# Target Audience

## Primary Persona: Worker

### Grace — The Kenyan Graduate

**Demographics**
- Age: 24
- Education: Communications degree from Kenyatta University (first in family to graduate)
- Location: Nairobi, Umoja estate (shares apartment with two roommates)
- Income: Variable; sends 3,000-5,000 KES home monthly to support younger brother's school fees
- Device: Tecno Spark (cracked screen), ~15,000 KES phone

**Psychographics**

*Values:*
- Dignity above all — will turn down degrading work even when she needs money
- Family obligation — her success is her family's success
- Competence — wants to be valued for her mind, not just her labor
- Stability — not excitement, just the ability to plan ahead

*Goals:*
- Close the gaps: rent on the 15th, brother's fees by the 20th, something to send home
- Work that uses her education and language skills
- Build something — not just survive, but progress
- Eventually: help her brother attend university

*Frustrations:*
- Did everything right (degree, skills, moved to the city) and the system shrugged
- 500 applicants for every job; someone's nephew always gets it
- Gig platforms that promise money, then vanish or ban with no explanation
- The constant math that doesn't add up

*Motivations:*
- Counter-evidence against the voice that says "maybe you're not worth more"
- Proving the degree wasn't wasted
- Being able to describe her work without embarrassment
- The feeling of Tuesday being different than it used to be

**Behavioral**

*How she discovers products:*
- Friend recommendation via WhatsApp group ("There's this thing where you do tasks and they pay you immediately")
- Skeptical until she sees proof (actual transaction history, not marketing)
- Won't tell anyone about it for 2 weeks — wants to confirm it's real first

*How she evaluates products:*
- Does it work on bad internet?
- Will it waste my data?
- Is it designed for people like me, or adapted from somewhere else?
- Has my friend actually gotten paid?

*How she makes decisions:*
- Evidence over claims
- Inherited trust (if her friend trusts it, she'll try it)
- Low friction to try, high bar to commit
- Watches for red flags learned from scams

*Current solutions:*
- Transcription work (when available)
- Social media management (pays irregularly)
- Tried selling makeup (margins impossible)
- Applied for "real jobs" constantly — 500 applicants per position

**Aesthetic Sensibilities**

*Brands she admires:*
- M-Pesa — reliability is the product
- WhatsApp — invisible infrastructure, works on terrible internet
- Safaricom — premium feel, local pride
- Java House — warm, aspirational, African but international-quality
- Tecno — designed for her market, not dumbed down from Western product

*Visual preferences:*
- Warm modern African: clean but not cold, earthy but not rural
- Colors: warm neutrals, deep teal, terracotta, subtle gold
- Avoids: NGO charity aesthetic, betting-app neon, "mzungu" pastels, overly corporate

*Products she loves:*
- M-Pesa (infrastructure)
- WhatsApp (social)
- TikTok (entertainment — knows her without asking)
- Royco cubes (consistency, inherited trust)

**The Wound**

"I did everything right and it didn't matter."

The slow death of believing the system is fair. A thousand small betrayals:
- The email that never comes
- "Processing" for three weeks while rent is due
- Banned with $47 pending, no explanation, no human
- Rates dropping with no announcement

The wound underneath: "Maybe they're right. Maybe I'm not worth more."

Every instant payment is a micro-repair. Not healing the wound — counter-evidence. Proof that it's possible to be treated as a person.

> "I finished a task and the money was already there. I didn't quite believe it the first time. By the tenth time, something started to relax."

## Secondary Persona: Worker

### Kofi — The Ghanaian Linguist

**Demographics**
- Age: 28
- Education: Linguistics degree, does translation work
- Location: Accra, Ghana
- Languages: Native Twi speaker, fluent English
- Device: Mid-range Android, power user

**Psychographics**

*Values:*
- Professional recognition for specialized skills
- Fair compensation for expertise (not commodity rates)
- Efficiency — manages multiple platforms, optimizes earnings

*Goals:*
- Premium rates for African language expertise
- Instant payment to mobile money
- Portable professional credentials

*Frustrations:*
- No platform values his Twi skills
- 30-60 day payment delays
- 84% platform take at competitors

**What makes Kofi different from Grace:**
- More experienced with gig platforms
- Higher earning potential (language expertise)
- Less emotional wound, more professional calculation
- Evaluates platforms on rate optimization, not survival

**Quote**
> "They charge clients $20/hour for Twi translation and pay me $2. Bawo at least tells me the real numbers."

## Primary Persona: Client

### Dr. Chen — ML Research Lead

**Demographics**
- Role: Data Quality Lead at Seed-stage AI startup
- Location: San Francisco / remote
- Budget: $5-25K per project
- Technical level: Comfortable with APIs, reviews code

**Psychographics**

*Values:*
- Technical rigor — she reads papers, reviews methodology
- Efficiency — doesn't want to manage vendors, wants results
- Defensible decisions — can explain to her team why she chose this vendor

*Goals:*
- High-quality Swahili sentiment data
- 48-hour turnaround
- Vendor she can put in a press release without flinching

*Frustrations:*
- Scale AI's Meta acquisition = conflict of interest
- Offshore BPOs don't have actual native speakers
- Sama controversy = PR risk
- Building in-house annotation is 5x more expensive

**Behavioral**

*How she discovers products:*
- Hacker News, ML Twitter, colleague recommendations
- Searches for specific capability ("Swahili sentiment labeling")
- Evaluates in 10 seconds: "Is this real? Can I put this in front of my team?"

*How she evaluates vendors:*
- API documentation (or preview of it)
- Actual metrics, not marketing claims
- Pricing visible, not "contact us"
- GitHub activity, named team members, verifiable evidence

*Red flags that kill instantly:*
- "AI-powered" without specifics
- Stock photos of diverse people at laptops
- Hidden pricing
- No technical documentation visible
- "Trusted by 500+ companies" with no logos

*Reference points for "good":*
- Stripe (clean, confident, developer-friendly)
- Hugging Face (technical credibility, community)
- Weights & Biases (developer tools that look good)

**Aesthetic Sensibilities**

*What signals credibility:*
- Lots of white space
- Typography does the heavy lifting
- Code snippets on homepage
- Clear information hierarchy
- Real metrics in case studies

*What signals amateur hour:*
- Gradients and glows everywhere
- Stock photos
- Animated counters
- Chat widget that pops up immediately
- Exclamation points in copy

**Quote**
> "Yeah, it's a data labeling platform focused on African languages. Native speakers in Kenya, instant payments, looks technically solid. Could be good for the Swahili stuff."

## Anti-Persona

### Who Bawo is NOT for

**Workers:**
- People looking to "get rich quick" with minimal effort
- Scammers trying to game the system with multiple accounts
- Workers who want to treat tasks as a game to be exploited, not work to be done well

**Clients:**
- Companies that just want the cheapest possible labor
- Buyers who want to hide labor practices from scrutiny
- Anyone who thinks "African data" means "discount data"

**Why this matters:**
Bawo's positioning depends on quality workers doing quality work for clients who value quality. Bad-faith participants on either side undermine the entire value proposition.

## The Two-Audience Challenge

| Grace (Worker) | Dr. Chen (Client) |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Warm, human, African | Clean, technical, professional |
| M-Pesa simplicity | Stripe documentation |
| Evidence she matters | Evidence you're legitimate |
| Mobile-first, data-conscious | Desktop-optimized, content-rich |
| Feels designed for her | Feels designed for serious work |

**Solution:** Same brand system, two expressions.
- Worker-facing: Warm palette, friendly UI, personal tone, MiniPay integration surface
- Client-facing: Sparse, documentation-forward, metrics-heavy, desktop marketing site

The accent color and core typography connect them. The contexts and tone adapt.
