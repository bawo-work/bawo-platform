# Logo Concept — Bawo

## Design Rationale

**Derivation from Brand Strategy:**

The name "Bawo" is Yoruba for "how are you?" — a warm greeting that establishes human connection. The logo must embody the Competent Caregiver archetype: professional reliability expressed with warmth, never corporate coldness or NGO charity aesthetic.

**Key constraints from strategy:**
- Must work on cracked Tecno screens in Nairobi sunlight
- Must signal credibility to Dr. Chen (technical clients)
- Must feel African without clichés (no kente patterns, no masks)
- Must avoid: crypto aesthetic, betting-app neon, NGO charity blue
- Technology is invisible — no blockchain/Web3 visual language

## Logo Concept: Clean Wordmark

**Concept: "Bawo" as confident, warm wordmark**

The logo is a custom-lettered wordmark in a clean, modern sans-serif with subtle rounded terminals. The "B" and "o" share slightly open forms that suggest approachability without being childish.

### Primary Wordmark

```
BAWO
```

**Typography specifications:**
- Based on Plus Jakarta Sans Display, modified
- Weight: SemiBold (600)
- Slightly increased letter-spacing (+2%)
- Rounded terminals on strokes (subtle, not bubbly)
- The "a" is single-story for friendliness
- The "w" has slight angles that suggest movement/exchange

**Color applications:**
- Primary: Deep Teal (#1A5F5A) on warm white
- Reversed: Warm White (#FEFCF8) on Deep Teal
- Single color: Black (#2C2925) for print/monochrome

### Symbol (Optional Secondary Mark)

**Concept: Exchange gesture**

A minimal mark suggesting two hands meeting in greeting — abstract enough to read as connection/exchange/transaction without being literal.

```
◎
```

**Visual:** Two curved lines meeting at a point, forming a circle with an opening — suggests:
- A greeting (Bawo)
- An exchange (fair trade)
- Continuation/cycle (instant payment loop)

**Application:**
- App icon (standalone)
- Favicon
- Small-format applications where wordmark won't work
- NOT required for primary branding

### Usage Rules

1. **Minimum clear space:** Height of "B" on all sides
2. **Minimum size:** 80px wide for digital, 20mm for print
3. **Never distort:** Maintain proportions
4. **Never add effects:** No gradients, shadows, outlines
5. **Never change colors:** Use only approved palette

## Confidence Level

| Decision | Confidence | Rationale |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Wordmark approach | 95% | Strategy emphasizes simplicity (M-Pesa, Stripe). Wordmark scales, requires no explanation. |
| Plus Jakarta Sans base | 90% | Matches "slightly rounded, modern sans-serif" from strategy. Alternative: Inter. |
| No symbol required | 85% | Clean wordmark is sufficient for MVP. Symbol adds complexity without clear need. |
| Deep Teal primary | 90% | Directly from strategy: "Deep teal or warm green, Safaricom confidence" |
| Warm terminals | 80% | Balances warmth (Grace) with professionalism (Dr. Chen). Could go slightly more geometric. |
